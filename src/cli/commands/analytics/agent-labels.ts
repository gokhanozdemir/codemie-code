/**
 * Human-readable agent labels for analytics output.
 *
 * Agent keys are internal ids (`copilot-cli`); these are what a reader should see. Agents
 * whose key already reads acceptably are simply absent and fall through unchanged, so
 * adding an entry here is optional.
 *
 * NOTE: the HTML report's client bundle (`report/client/app.js`) carries its own copy of
 * this map. It is a standalone browser script and cannot import from TypeScript modules —
 * the same reason `AGENT_COLORS` lives only there. Keep the two in sync when adding an agent.
